<b>Procedure of the simulator of the experiment:</b><br>
<b>Sample Preparation</b><br>
1.	Annealing of the hypo eutectoid steel specimen by heating the sample to about 910°C temperature and holding the specimen at this temperature for a definite time, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature in the furnace.<br>
2.	Normalizing of the hypo eutectoid steel specimen by heating the sample to about 910°C temperature and holding it 1hr at this temperature for homogeneous austenitisation followed by cooling to room temperature in air.<br>
3.	Hardening of the hypo eutectoid steel specimen by heating the sample to about 910°C temperature and holding it 1hr at this temperature, followed by quenching in water.<br>
<b><u>Polishing</u></b><br>
To reveal the microstructure, polish and etch the samples using the procedure described in Experiment 1 in the first set of labs.<br>
<b><u>Observations under Microscope</u></b> 
4.	Observe each specimen under an optical microscope.
