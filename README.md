### About the Experiment 

A heat treatment of an alloy involves three basic steps: heating, soaking, and cooling at desired rates. Heat treatments are usually carried out to alter the microstructure of metals and alloys to tune their properties for various applications. Heat treatment can also alter certain manufacturability objectives, such as improving machining, enhancing formability, and restoring ductility after a cold working operation. The method chosen depends on the desired characteristics of the material. Steels are the most widely used engineering material as their properties can be varied widely by employing suitable heat treatment schedules.
